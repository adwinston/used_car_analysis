Reasons for removals:

VIN: Can lead to over-fitting, vehicle identification number. May be able to extract value from Regex at a later date.
bed_height: Only contains NaN and '--'. 
city: Removing due to high dimensionality, could be parsed in the future to generalize to regions.
combine_fuel_economy: The entire column was null
description: Can get other vital information from other variables. Can revisit and attempt to parse in the future
